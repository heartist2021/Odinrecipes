    <h3>Fresh Tomato Soup</h3>
    <p>This simple, quick and easy recipe for homemade fresh tomato soup is perfect to make when tomatoes are ripe in gardens and farmers' markets for a delicious summertime treat.</p>
    <h3>How to Make Tomato Soup</h3>
    <p>Sometimes we're so hung up on the ease of using canned soup, that we forget making homemade soup is actually easy too. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief idea of what you can expect from this tomato soup recipe:</p>
    <h3>Boil the Tomatoes, Onion, Cloves, and Chicken Broth</h3>
    <p>In a large stockpot, boil the tomatoes, onion, garlic cloves, and chicken broth until the flavors blend together, about 20 minutes. Run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl. This will separate any big chunks, plus the tomato skins.

        If you don't have a food mill, a food processor or immersion blender will work too.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, onion, cloves and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors. Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.</li>
            <li>In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until the roux is a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir in the rest. Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.</li>
